Amazon Retail receives billions of reviews on its products every year. Some of these reviews indicate a safety issue and a need to potentially suppress the product (ASIN). In these cases, review text is sent to annotation teams worldwide that decide whether there is a product safety issue or not.

The team responsible for this annotation is looking at a potential Machine Learning solution to automate this process given the extensive dataset created.

ML Problem:
This is a binary classification problem of using review text, review title, star rating and date information to predict if a product is a Product Safety Issue (1) or Not Product Safety Issue (0). We will be using F1 score as our evaluation metric.

Task and Deliverables:
Use your model to predict on the public_test_features and submit to Leaderboard. You can submit as many times to Leaderboard as you like. Each student must individually submit.
